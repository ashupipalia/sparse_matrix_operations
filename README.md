# sparse_matrix_operations

If most of the elements in the matrix are zero, then the matrix is called a sparse matrix.
Here I implement in code addition transpose and multiplication operations.
I used a compressed sparse row (CSR) for solving the problem.

I used data structure for storing the row, column, and matrix values stored in Adjacency List form where a row is a vector and each row contains the vector of pairs where each pair is column and value.
random_gen_matrix() -> this method give random coordinates and and each have random values.
